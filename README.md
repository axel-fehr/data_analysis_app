# Data Analysis App

This is the repository for a mobile application implemented with Dart and Flutter that can be used to track various activities and events (e.g. sleep, exercise or coffee consumption) on a daily basis. The app analyzes the resulting data and provides insights for the user, such as correlations between different activities and events that are being tracked in order to uncover non-obvious connections between them.

The app was also published on the Google Play Store.
